<p>Title:      Is Artificial Intelligence reasonable?</p>

<h2 id="is-artificial-intelligence-reasonable-">Is Artificial Intelligence reasonable?</h2>
<p>The twenty-first century is the age of outbreak in science and technology. A few decades ago, we could not imagine a palm-sized device could help us connect with our friends, who may live hundreds of miles away, in a few seconds. This device totally reshaped people’s daily lives. Of course, I mean the mobile phone. Eventually, another new technology will reshape our lives again. The process likes a never-ending loop. Humans develop technology first, and then the technology will quickly support humans’ lives. In recent years, a large amount of data gave computers the ability to think and make judgments. We call this technology artificial intelligence (A.I.). Many engineers believe A.I. field will redefine people’s ways of living again. This new machine can independently think, judge by data, and even help people make decisions. A.I. will act as the world’s most rigorous, logical assistant. People need such an assistant in their lives. Meanwhile, everything has a dark side. A.I.’s independent thinking and judgment makes people fear for its existence. While A.I. benefits all aspects of our lives, we still don’t know whether A.I. will also bring people to destruction and crisis. So, what can we gain and lose from A.I.?</p>
<p>Generally, calculation and learning are the biggest advantages of A.I. Using a large amount of data and codes, A.I. can provide a very accurate calculation. Based on the results of this calculation, A.I. can improve their skills automatically. This approach is called independent learning ability. For example, people need a minimum of twenty years to learn the basic knowledge of human history, but A.I. machines may only need a few minutes or even a few seconds to learn this knowledge. Gaining information is much simpler and easier for the A.I. machine. Three years ago, Google’s Alphago A.I. robot competed with the world’s number-one go player.</p>

<p>Alphago could practice more than ten thousand times every night in order to exploit its defects and improve its strategy. However, our world number-one human go player may spend his entire life practicing ten thousand times. There is an obvious efficiency-gap between humans and A.I. Even if we spend our entire life practicing the game, we still find impossible to memorize everything. A.I. can permanently store information in a small memory chip as long as no damage. However, human memory is totally different. We cannot remember a lot of data in the long term. This reflects A.I.’s strong learning ability. Therefore, A.I. has a profound temptation for our lives and business.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1*1khR60e4guqXFta7_0L1EQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A.I. has a rapid and strong feedback ability. Once people use code to explain how to collect and use information, then A.I. can give no emotional bias feedback in a very short period of time. A.I. won’t judge via emotion, but by logic. Therefore, A.I. is an ideal assistant toward research and logical analysis. This ability can reduce human error and highly promote technology development. Humans can claim A.I. is the best logic-judgment assistant for engineers and scientists. It has a more cogent analysis and data processing feedback ability. If we go further, A.I. may get rid of the control of human beings, and independently judge things according to a database.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these obvious advantages also cause some uncontrollable fear. I remember a post I read before where “Facebook abandoned an experiment when two artificially intelligent programs appeared to be chatting to each other in a strange language only they understood.” For humans, this behavior equates to a new life, which is an uncontrollable project. After this incident, people are focusing on the security of artificial intelligence again. However, I think this is an excessive opinion. Humans create artificial intelligence. Programmers can control the primary level in A.I.-Codes. A.I. machines will more strictly obey rules than human beings. Don’t fear A.I. machines, they are only made up of intelligent code and their power supports social development.</p>

<p>Humans can’t deny the A.I advantages even if some risks exist. A.I. is a powerful tool for improving people’s lives in all areas. Efficient, intelligent, logical, and independent: our society needs these abilities. We can imagine what will happen when large numbers of A.I. machines exist in our lives. Humans will be liberated, and A.I. will do the work. All lives will become simpler and easier. People can do whatever they enjoy. Meanwhile, A.I. machines can also greatly reduce hunger and unfair events. Our lives will become more comfortable, creating a world people will look forward to.</p>
